# SERVERLESS

This directory contains standalone scripts intended for deployment to a
serverless computing environment.

## Contents

* `harvest/`
  * `organisations`: Harvests organisations from the Entity API and writes to
    Redis cache, for use on organisation hub page.

## TODO

1. Consider whether these really belong here in the portal.js repo, or elsewhere
